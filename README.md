# Heuristic-Graph-Optimization-for-Bipartite-Subgraph-Problem

In this project, we implemented a graph optimization algorithm using a heuristic approach. The goal of the project was to find an approximate solution to the bipartite subgraph problem in graphs. we designed and implemented a heuristic algorithm that leverages local search techniques to iteratively improve the solution. The algorithm was compared against a brute force algorithm for benchmarking purposes.

Throughout the project, we conducted extensive experimental analysis to evaluate the performance of the heuristic algorithm. We measured the computation time of both the brute force and heuristic algorithms on various graph sizes. Additionally, we analyzed the solution quality of the heuristic algorithm by comparing it to the exact solution obtained from the brute force algorithm.

The project involved implementing the algorithms in Python and utilizing libraries such as NetworkX for graph manipulation and statistical analysis packages like matplotlib and seaborn for visualization. we presented the results using clear and informative graphs, showcasing the performance and solution quality metrics.

This project allowed us to strengthen my skills in algorithm design, optimization, data analysis, and visualization. It also demonstrated the ability to tackle complex graph problems and develop efficient heuristic solutions. Overall, the project provided valuable insights into graph optimization techniques and their practical applications.
